# backend-a2

Hi! Thanks for looking through this repo. This is a repo made for the progress of the course of cmda-be.

## How to run
Currently this repo has a `app.js` file that spins up an express server.

First of all, clone this project by running this in your terminal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daoneandonly/backend-a2
```

Then move into the project
```bash
cd backend-a2
```

### Running the Node script

First install the project by running
```bash
npm install
```
Now run node `dev` script which will run `app.js`. Do this by running the following command

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Starting the project
If you wish to start the project you can run the npm `start` command:

```sh
npm run start
```


# Database structure

The database currently supports a single structure for a user. A `user` entity in the following structure:

```JSON
{
  "_id": "abc", // id generated by mongodb
  "name": "Darth Vader", // name of user
  "job": "Sith Lord", // current job of user
  "quote": "I find your lack of faith disturbing." // A personal quote of the user
}
```

# For the team

## Branch
We work with branches to work along with eachother. `Main` should *never* be merged without approval. Anything feature should be merged to the `develop` branch.

### How to add branch
First create a branch with the command
```sh
git branch -m "name-of-your-feature"
```

Then switch to that branch by using `checkout`.
```sh
git checkout "name-of-your-feature"
```

Alternatively you can do both at the same time by using the flag `-b` in the checkout command
```sh
git checkout -b "name-of-your-feature"
```

Do your code and don't forget to commit often
